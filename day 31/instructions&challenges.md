## Write a Program to Find the Factorial of a Number

The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number. For example,

factorial of 5 is equal to 1 \* 2 \* 3 \* 4 \* 5 = 120.

The factorial of a positive number n is given by:

factorial of n (n!) = 1 \* 2 \* 3 \* 4.....n The factorial of negative numbers do not exist and the factorial of 0 is 1.

## CHALLENGES (3/3 DONE)

- [x] `factorial(2)` is `2`.

- [x] `factorial(5)` is `120`.

- [x] `factorial(10)` is `3628800`.
