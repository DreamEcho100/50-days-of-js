# INSTRUCTIONS&CHALLENGES

## Mumbling

Each char becomes `n*chars` where n is the index + 1, and the first char is capitalized divided by `-` instead of space.

Only alphabets are passed as arguments for the `accum(s)` funciton

Example: `accum("ZpglnRxqenU")` should return `"Z-Pp-Ggg-Llll-Nnnnn-Rrrrrr-Xxxxxxx-Qqqqqqqq-Eeeeeeeee-Nnnnnnnnnn-Uuuuuuuuuuu"`
